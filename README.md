# Introduction

I have created this project to easily set up a new environment with all my configuration files.

# Usage

Just clone the project somewhere and run the shell script. I am personally using `~/.config/`.

    $ cd ~/.config/
    $ clone https://github.com/dgellow/home-bootstrapping.git dgellow
    $ cd dgellow
    $ sh bootstrap.sh
